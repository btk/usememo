This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors. <br/><br/> We will remove any data collected from you, using your inputs or GitHub, if you send us an email on <a href="mailto:legal@usememo.com">legal@usememo.com</a> with your GitHub username or your email address, if it is public on GitHub.</div>
